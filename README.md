# Analysis of EV Charging at National Parks
In this Jupyter Notebook, we explore the current status of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in and around US National Parks.

## Overview

This script is designed to calculate the number of EV charging stations within a 50-mile radius of each National Park. It then provides a comparative analysis between the growth of charging stations and key factors such as the number of EV registrations and prevailing gas prices.
